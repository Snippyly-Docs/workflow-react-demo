# Base React Demo

This repo serves as a template for a basic setup of React v18 + TS created with `create-react-app`, and with the **Snippyly SDK** pre-installed with a test API key.

## Code Examples

You can view **Snippyly** specific code examples by searching for `Snippyly Code Example` in your IDE. For example if you use **VS Code**, use the following:

### Windows + Linux

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>

### OSX

<kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>

and search for the term: `Snippyly Code Example`.

## Searching Specific Features

If you want to search for specific feature implementations, we structured the comments in this project to make that easy for you. For example, to search for **Live Cursors** you can search the string: `Feature: Live Cursors`.
